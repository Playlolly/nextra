# LegacyFuel

If you have [LegacyFuel](https://github.com/InZidiuZ/LegacyFuel) installed on your server you need to blacklist the Tesla vehicles. In order to accomplish this, add the following configuration to the LegacyFuel `config.lua` file on line `58`.

## Configuration

```lua
Config.Blacklist = { 2006210393, 967185883, -1290262746, 1717202867, -964913869, -450863688, 170327252, 2014463299 }
