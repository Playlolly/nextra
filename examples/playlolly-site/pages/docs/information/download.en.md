# Download

After purchasing the resource you'll receive an email with a download link. Alternatively, you may head to Keymaster [here](https://keymaster.fivem.net/login) and download it.

After logging into Keymaster, navigate to the _Purchased Assets_ tab and download the resource. This is where you'll find the latest updates.

If it isn't appearing on Keymaster, make sure you are logged in with the same FiveM account that you checked out with.

## Authentication System

We use _FiveM's Tebex Escrow System_ found [here](https://forum.cfx.re/t/introducing-asset-escrow-for-your-resources/4777151). This system is much more secure for our customers and ensures only those who have purchased our products are able to use them.
