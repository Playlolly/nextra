# Installation

## Server Version

Before installing the resource, please check your Server Artifacts version as you must be using at least version 4752 for our resources to work. This is a requirement set by FiveM with their _Asset Escrow System_.

If you need further assistance, please get in touch with our Support Team via our Discord server.

## Installation

After downloading the resource installing it is simple thanks to _FiveM's Tebex Escrow System_.

1. Navigate to the **resources** folder of your server, this is where you'll install the resource.

2. Create a new folder for the resource and place the contents of the zip file inside it that you previously downloaded.

There are no additional steps to the installation, the resource is now ready to be started and configured if needed.
