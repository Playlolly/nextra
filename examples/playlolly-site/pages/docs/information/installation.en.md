# Installation

## Server Version

Before installing the resource, please check your Server Artifacts version as you must be using at least version `5181` for our resources to work. This is a requirement set by FiveM with their _Asset Escrow System_.

If you need further assistance, please get in touch with our Support Team via our Discord server.

## Installation

After downloading the resource installing it is simple thanks to _FiveM's Tebex Escrow System_.

1. Navigate to the `resources` folder of your server, this is where you'll install the resource.

2. Create a new folder named `[playlolly|` for the resources and place the contents of the previously downloaded zip files in it. Ensure hidden files are copied; the `.fxap` file in a protected resource must be included. Some FTP programs skip these files.

3. Only start the `playlolly-tesla-core` resource in your server config with `ensure playlolly-tesla-core`. All other Playlolly resources will be started automatically.

4. If you have LegacyFuel in use or other fueling scripts blacklist the electric vehicles in these as explained [here](../tesla-core/legacy-fuel).

There are no additional steps to the installation, the resource is now ready to be used and configured if needed.
