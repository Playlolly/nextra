# Introduction

## Using our Documentation

We try to provide accurate and up to date documentation for our _paid_ resources in order to make the installation experience as smooth as possible for our customers.

Before contacting us about any issues you are having, always check the documentation first and try to resolve it. If you are still not able to, we'll be more than happy to help.

### Support Channels

**Discord Server** - Our Discord server is the fastest way to get support live from either other members of the community in our public #support channel or from our Support Team by opening a ticket. Join [here](https://discord.gg/BC73kTVSTK).

**FiveM Forum** - You can message us through our FiveM forum profile found [here](https://forum.cfx.re/u/playlolly).

## Join our Discord Server

The _Playlolly Discord Server_ is the best way to stay up to date with our resources, get exclusive insights into our new resources and even get support for our resources.

We have a _Support Team_ available to help and we also have a ticket system, enabling you to open a ticket and get private assistance. Alternatively, our community support channels allow you to get quicker help from other members of the community, such as server owners.

Customers get access to an exclusive section of the Discord, this is where we'll notify you about updates to resources so you can download them from Keymaster.

If you didn't link your Discord at checkout, just open a ticket and we'll be able to add this for you.
